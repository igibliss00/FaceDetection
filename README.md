## Abtract

 Face Detection app using the MVVM architecture.  Using the `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest` object of Apple's Vision framework, the app locates the faces in within a view finder of a device's camera. A view model then uses Combine to listen to the changes in the number of faces detected and updates its state to be reflected on the UI.
